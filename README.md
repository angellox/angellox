### Ángel Cruz - @angellox

Hi, I’m @angellox this is my little summarize about me. I've been working on a wide variety of projects about web design, you'll be able to check them soon. I like to work with frameworks like react or vue.js but I'm always going to prefer working with Javascript, PHP, Python etc, purely. I hope you're here because you got a love for programming like me.

### My tools:

  - 💥 PHP, C
  - 👅 HTML5, CSS, JavaScript 
  - :wave: AJAX.
  - 🐍 Python
  - 🌝 Surely more...
